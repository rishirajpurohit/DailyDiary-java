This is the DailyDiary Project.

[PASSWORD PROTECTED]

pasword is:  rex
which can be easily changed if you know a little of java.

A menu driven java project to create entries and view entries just like you do in Diary.

The program is not made executable and thus java files work in console(cmd.exe)
